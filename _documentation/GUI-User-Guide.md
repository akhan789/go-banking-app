## üöÄ Launching the Application

1. Prerequisites:
    - Download the release.zip from the releases in the github.
    - Extract the zip.
    - Ideally run on a windows system as the release folder contains windows scripts.
2. Run the Application:
    - Execute the `run.bat` batch file. This will automatically create all required folders and start every server and ultimately start the swing ui.
    - The GUI will open in a window titled "Go Banking App" (configurable via service.properties).
3. (Optional) Every server and the swing ui itself has a properties file under config folder of the respective project `service.properties` which allows you to configure each individual server and the ui.
